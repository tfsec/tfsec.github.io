title: GEN005 - The attribute has potentially sensitive data, passwords, tokens or keys in it
summary: The attribute has potentially sensitive data, passwords, tokens or keys in it 
resources: [] 
permalink: /docs/general/GEN005/
---
### Explanation


Sensitive data stored in attributes can result in compromised data. Sensitive data should be passed in through secret variables



### Possible Impact
Sensitive credentials may be compromised

### Suggested Resolution
Check the code for vulnerabilities and move to variables


### Insecure Example

The following example will fail the GEN005 check.

{% highlight terraform %}

resource "aws_instance" "bad_example" {
	instance_type = "t2.small"

	user_data = <<EOF
		Password = "something secret"
EOF

}

{% endhighlight %}



### Secure Example

The following example will pass the GEN005 check.

{% highlight terraform %}

variable "password" {
	type = string
}

resource "aws_instance" "good_instance" {
	instance_type = "t2.small"

	user_data = <<EOF
		Password = var.password
EOF

}

{% endhighlight %}

summary: Force destroy is enabled on Spaces bucket which is dangerous 
resources: [digitalocean_spaces_bucket]

---
### Explanation


Enabling force destroy on a Spaces bucket means that the bucket can be deleted without the additional check that it is empty. This risks important data being accidentally deleted by a bucket removal process.


### Possible Impact
Accidental deletion of bucket objects

### Suggested Resolution
Don't use force destroy on bucket configuration


### Insecure Example

The following example will fail the DIG007 check.

{% highlight terraform %}

resource "digitalocean_spaces_bucket" "bad_example" {
  name   		= "foobar"
  region 		= "nyc3"
  force_destroy = true
}

{% endhighlight %}



### Secure Example

The following example will pass the DIG007 check.

{% highlight terraform %}

resource "digitalocean_spaces_bucket" "good_example" {
  name   = "foobar"
  region = "nyc3"
}

{% endhighlight %}

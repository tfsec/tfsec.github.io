### Explanation


When working with a server, youâ€™ll likely spend most of your time in a terminal session connected to your server through SSH. A more secure alternative to password-based logins, SSH keys use encryption to provide a secure way of logging into your server and are recommended for all users.


### Impact
Logging in with username and password is easier to compromise

### Resolution
Use ssh keys for login



### Insecure Example

The following example will fail the DIG003 check.

{% highlight terraform %}

resource "digitalocean_droplet" "good_example" {
	image    = "ubuntu-18-04-x64"
	name     = "web-1"
	region   = "nyc2"
	size     = "s-1vcpu-1gb"
 }

{% endhighlight %}



### Secure Example

The following example will pass the DIG003 check.

{% highlight terraform %}

data "digitalocean_ssh_key" "terraform" {
	name = "myKey"
  }
  
resource "digitalocean_droplet" "good_example" {
	image    = "ubuntu-18-04-x64"
	name     = "web-1"
	region   = "nyc2"
	size     = "s-1vcpu-1gb"
	ssh_keys = [ data.digitalocean_ssh_key.myKey.id ]
}

{% endhighlight %}

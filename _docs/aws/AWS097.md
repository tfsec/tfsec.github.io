title: AWS097 - IAM customer managed policies should not allow decryption actions on all KMS keys
summary: IAM customer managed policies should not allow decryption actions on all KMS keys 
resources: [aws_iam_policy_document] 
permalink: /docs/aws/AWS097/
---
### Explanation


IAM policies define which actions an identity (user, group, or role) can perform on which resources. Following security best practices, AWS recommends that you allow least privilege. In other words, you should grant to identities only the kms:Decrypt or kms:ReEncryptFrom permissions and only for the keys that are required to perform a task.



### Insecure Example

The following example will fail the AWS097 check.

{% highlight terraform %}

data "aws_iam_policy_document" "kms_policy" {
  statement {
    principals {
      type        = "AWS"
      identifiers = ["arn:aws:iam::${data.aws_caller_identity.current.account_id}:root"]
    }
    actions   = ["kms:*"]
    resources = ["*"]
  }
}

{% endhighlight %}



### Secure Example

The following example will pass the AWS097 check.

{% highlight terraform %}

data "aws_iam_policy_document" "kms_policy" {
  statement {
    principals {
      type        = "AWS"
      identifiers = ["arn:aws:iam::${data.aws_caller_identity.current.account_id}:root"]
    }
    actions   = ["kms:*"]
    resources = [aws_kms_key.main.arn]
  }
}

{% endhighlight %}

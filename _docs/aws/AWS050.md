summary: An ingress Network ACL rule allows ALL ports from /0. 
resources: [aws_network_acl_rule]

---
### Explanation


Opening up ACLs to the public internet is potentially dangerous. You should restrict access to IP addresses or ranges that explicitly require it where possible, and ensure that you specify required ports.



### Possible Impact
All ports exposed for egressing data to the internet

### Suggested Resolution
Set a more restrictive cidr range


### Insecure Example

The following example will fail the AWS050 check.

{% highlight terraform %}

resource "aws_network_acl_rule" "bad_example" {
  egress         = false
  protocol       = "all"
  rule_action    = "allow"
  cidr_block     = "0.0.0.0/0"
}

{% endhighlight %}



### Secure Example

The following example will pass the AWS050 check.

{% highlight terraform %}

resource "aws_network_acl_rule" "good_example" {
  egress         = false
  protocol       = "tcp"
  from_port      = 22
  to_port        = 22
  rule_action    = "allow"
  cidr_block     = "0.0.0.0/0"
}

{% endhighlight %}

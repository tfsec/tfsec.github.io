title: AWS001 - S3 Bucket has an ACL defined which allows public access.
summary: S3 Bucket has an ACL defined which allows public access. 
resources: [aws_s3_bucket] 
permalink: /docs/aws/AWS001/
---
### Explanation


S3 bucket permissions should be set to deny public access unless explicitly required.

Granting write access publicly with <code>public-read-write</code> is especially dangerous as you will be billed for any uploaded files.

Additionally, you should not use the <code>authenticated-read</code> canned ACL, as this provides read access to any authenticated AWS user, not just AWS users within your organisation.


### Impact
The contents of the bucket can be accessed publicly

### Resolution
Apply a more restrictive bucket ACL



### Insecure Example

The following example will fail the AWS001 check.

{% highlight terraform %}

resource "aws_s3_bucket" "bad_example" {
	acl = "public-read"
}

{% endhighlight %}



### Secure Example

The following example will pass the AWS001 check.

{% highlight terraform %}

resource "aws_s3_bucket" "good_example" {
	acl = "private"
}

{% endhighlight %}

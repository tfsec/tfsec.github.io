title: AWS048 - EFS Encryption has not been enabled
summary: EFS Encryption has not been enabled 
resources: [aws_efs_file_system] 
permalink: /docs/aws/AWS048/
---
### Explanation


If your organization is subject to corporate or regulatory policies that require encryption of data and metadata at rest, we recommend creating a file system that is encrypted at rest, and mounting your file system using encryption of data in transit.



### Impact
Data can be read from the EFS if compromised

### Resolution
Enable encryption for EFS



### Insecure Example

The following example will fail the AWS048 check.

{% highlight terraform %}

resource "aws_efs_file_system" "bad_example" {
  name       = "bar"
  encrypted  = false
  kms_key_id = ""
}
{% endhighlight %}



### Secure Example

The following example will pass the AWS048 check.

{% highlight terraform %}

resource "aws_efs_file_system" "good_example" {
  name       = "bar"
  encrypted  = true
  kms_key_id = "my_kms_key"
}
{% endhighlight %}

{% highlight terraform %}

resource "aws_s3_bucket_public_access_block" "bad_example" {
	bucket = aws_s3_bucket.example.id
}

resource "aws_s3_bucket_public_access_block" "bad_example" {
	bucket = aws_s3_bucket.example.id
  
	block_public_policy = false
}

{% endhighlight %}

{% highlight terraform %}

resource "aws_s3_bucket_public_access_block" "good_example" {
	bucket = aws_s3_bucket.example.id

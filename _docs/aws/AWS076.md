### Explanation


S3 bucket policy should have block public policy to prevent users from PUTing a policy that enable public access.


### Impact
Users could put a policy that allows public access

### Resolution
Prevent policies that allow public access being PUT



### Insecure Example

The following example will fail the AWS076 check.

{% highlight terraform %}

resource "aws_s3_bucket_public_access_block" "bad_example" {
	bucket = aws_s3_bucket.example.id
}

resource "aws_s3_bucket_public_access_block" "bad_example" {
	bucket = aws_s3_bucket.example.id
  
	block_public_policy = false
}

{% endhighlight %}



### Secure Example

The following example will pass the AWS076 check.

{% highlight terraform %}

resource "aws_s3_bucket_public_access_block" "good_example" {
	bucket = aws_s3_bucket.example.id
  
	block_public_policy = true
}

{% endhighlight %}

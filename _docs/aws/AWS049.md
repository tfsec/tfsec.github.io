summary: An ingress Network ACL rule allows specific ports from /0. 
resources: [aws_network_acl_rule]

### Explanation


Opening up ACLs to the public internet is potentially dangerous. You should restrict access to IP addresses or ranges that explicitly require it where possible.



### Impact
The ports are exposed for ingressing data to the internet

### Resolution
Set a more restrictive cidr range



### Insecure Example

The following example will fail the AWS049 check.

{% highlight terraform %}

resource "aws_network_acl_rule" "bad_example" {
  egress         = false
  protocol       = "tcp"
  from_port      = 22
  to_port        = 22
  rule_action    = "allow"
  cidr_block     = "0.0.0.0/0"
}

{% endhighlight %}



### Secure Example

The following example will pass the AWS049 check.

{% highlight terraform %}

resource "aws_network_acl_rule" "good_example" {
  egress         = false
  protocol       = "tcp"
  from_port      = 22
  to_port        = 22
  rule_action    = "allow"
  cidr_block     = "10.0.0.0/16"
}

{% endhighlight %}

summary: Unencrypted SNS topic. 
resources: [aws_sns_topic] 
permalink: /docs/aws/AWS016/
---
### Explanation


Queues should be encrypted with customer managed KMS keys and not default AWS managed keys, in order to allow granular control over access to specific queues.


### Possible Impact
The SNS topic messages could be read if compromised

### Suggested Resolution
Turn on SNS Topic encryption


### Insecure Example

The following example will fail the AWS016 check.

{% highlight terraform %}

resource "aws_sns_topic" "bad_example" {
	# no key id specified
}

{% endhighlight %}



### Secure Example

The following example will pass the AWS016 check.

{% highlight terraform %}

resource "aws_sns_topic" "good_example" {
	kms_master_key_id = "/blah"
}

{% endhighlight %}

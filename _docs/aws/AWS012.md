title: AWS012 - A resource has a public IP address.
summary: A resource has a public IP address. 
resources: [aws_launch_configuration aws_instance] 
permalink: /docs/aws/AWS012/
---
### Explanation


You should limit the provision of public IP addresses for resources. Resources should not be exposed on the public internet, but should have access limited to consumers required for the function of your application. 


### Possible Impact
The instance or configuration is publically accessible

### Suggested Resolution
Set the instance to not be publically accessible


### Insecure Example

The following example will fail the AWS012 check.

{% highlight terraform %}

resource "aws_launch_configuration" "bad_example" {
	associate_public_ip_address = true
}

{% endhighlight %}



### Secure Example

The following example will pass the AWS012 check.

{% highlight terraform %}

resource "aws_launch_configuration" "good_example" {
	associate_public_ip_address = false
}

{% endhighlight %}

### Explanation


Opening up ports to connect out to the public internet is generally to be avoided. You should restrict access to IP addresses or ranges that are explicitly required where possible.


### Impact
Your port is egressing data to the internet

### Resolution
Set a more restrictive cidr range



### Insecure Example

The following example will fail the AWS007 check.

{% highlight terraform %}

resource "aws_security_group_rule" "bad_example" {
	type = "egress"
	cidr_blocks = ["0.0.0.0/0"]
}

{% endhighlight %}



### Secure Example

The following example will pass the AWS007 check.

{% highlight terraform %}

resource "aws_security_group_rule" "good_example" {
	type = "egress"
	cidr_blocks = ["10.0.0.0/16"]
}

{% endhighlight %}

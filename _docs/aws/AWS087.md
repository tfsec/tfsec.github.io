title: AWS087 - Redshift cluster should be deployed into a specific VPC
summary: Redshift cluster should be deployed into a specific VPC 
resources: [aws_redshift_cluster] 
permalink: /docs/aws/AWS087/
---
### Explanation


Redshift clusters that are created without subnet details will be created in EC2 classic mode, meaning that they will be outside of a known VPC and running in tennant.

In order to benefit from the additional security features achieved with using an owned VPC, the subnet should be set.


### Impact
Redshift cluster does not benefit from VPC security if it is deployed in EC2 classic mode

### Resolution
Deploy Redshift cluster into a non default VPC



### Insecure Example

The following example will fail the AWS087 check.

{% highlight terraform %}

resource "aws_redshift_cluster" "bad_example" {
	cluster_identifier = "tf-redshift-cluster"
	database_name      = "mydb"
	master_username    = "foo"
	master_password    = "Mustbe8characters"
	node_type          = "dc1.large"
	cluster_type       = "single-node"
}

{% endhighlight %}



### Secure Example

The following example will pass the AWS087 check.

{% highlight terraform %}

resource "aws_redshift_cluster" "good_example" {
	cluster_identifier = "tf-redshift-cluster"
	database_name      = "mydb"
	master_username    = "foo"
	master_password    = "Mustbe8characters"
	node_type          = "dc1.large"
	cluster_type       = "single-node"

	cluster_subnet_group_name = "redshift_subnet"
}

{% endhighlight %}

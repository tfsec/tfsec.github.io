### Explanation


IAM account password policies should ensure that passwords content including at least one lowercase character.


### Impact
Short, simple passwords are easier to compromise

### Resolution
Enforce longer, more complex passwords in the policy



### Insecure Example

The following example will fail the AWS042 check.

{% highlight terraform %}

resource "aws_iam_account_password_policy" "bad_example" {
	# ...
	# require_lowercase_characters not set
	# ...
}

{% endhighlight %}



### Secure Example

The following example will pass the AWS042 check.

{% highlight terraform %}

resource "aws_iam_account_password_policy" "good_example" {
	# ...
	require_lowercase_characters = true
	# ...
}

{% endhighlight %}

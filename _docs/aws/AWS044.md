summary: AWS provider has access credentials specified. 
resources: [aws]

### Explanation


The AWS provider block should not contain hardcoded credentials. These can be passed in securely as runtime using environment variables.


### Impact
Exposing the credentials in the Terraform provider increases the risk of secret leakage

### Resolution
Don't include access credentials in plain text



### Insecure Example

The following example will fail the AWS044 check.

{% highlight terraform %}

provider "aws" {
  access_key = "AKIAABCD12ABCDEF1ABC"
  secret_key = "s8d7ghas9dghd9ophgs9"
}

{% endhighlight %}



### Secure Example

The following example will pass the AWS044 check.

{% highlight terraform %}

provider "aws" {
}

{% endhighlight %}

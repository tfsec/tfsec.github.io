### Explanation


IAM account password policies should ensure that passwords content including a symbol.


### Possible Impact
Short, simple passwords are easier to compromise

### Suggested Resolution
Enforce longer, more complex passwords in the policy


### Insecure Example

The following example will fail the AWS040 check.

{% highlight terraform %}

resource "aws_iam_account_password_policy" "bad_example" {
	# ...
	# require_symbols not set
	# ...
}

{% endhighlight %}



### Secure Example

The following example will pass the AWS040 check.

{% highlight terraform %}

resource "aws_iam_account_password_policy" "good_example" {
	# ...
	require_symbols = true
	# ...
}

{% endhighlight %}

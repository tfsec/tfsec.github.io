title: AWS024 - Kinesis stream is unencrypted.
summary: Kinesis stream is unencrypted. 
resources: [aws_kinesis_stream] 
permalink: /docs/aws/AWS024/
---
### Explanation


Kinesis streams should be encrypted to ensure sensitive data is kept private. Additionally, non-default KMS keys should be used so granularity of access control can be ensured.


### Impact
Intercepted data can be read in transit

### Resolution
Enable in transit encryption



### Insecure Example

The following example will fail the AWS024 check.

{% highlight terraform %}

resource "aws_kinesis_stream" "bad_example" {
	encryption_type = "NONE"
}

{% endhighlight %}



### Secure Example

The following example will pass the AWS024 check.

{% highlight terraform %}

resource "aws_kinesis_stream" "good_example" {
	encryption_type = "KMS"
	kms_key_id = "my/special/key"
}

{% endhighlight %}
